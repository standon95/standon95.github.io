I am currently a pre-doctoral research specialist working with Henrik Kleven and Ilyana Kuziemko at Princeton University. My research interests lie at the intersection of public economics, development, and gender. I graduated with an MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics in 2018, after receiving my Bachelor's degree in Economics from St. Stephen's College, Delhi University.
